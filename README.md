# AndroidProject-MusicAlarm

My first Android project  - plays whole music from device (randomly too) on demanded time and date

minor bugs and next to nothing interface

maybe will fix it one day..



KNOWN BUGS: 
- Toast overflow (showing way too many times) - maybe other way to show
- Not restarting play on alarm if app already playing or played music and not closed before (tho theres info on action bar)
- Sometimes hang on restart device
- Abandoned back process if hang

TODO:
- New not mockup interface
- Fix for restart device app hang
- Fix for alarm not work when already playing music
- Better way to turn off
- Diffrent way to show saved dates (now they not refresh themselves)
- Deleting single alarm 
- Add vibration turn off only


it still work as music player pretty flawless tho ;)
